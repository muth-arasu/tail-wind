[
    Layouts First Approach :
    Onely if you have same navbar for every page==>
    1.which Optimise the react code as well as rendering time .
    2.we need create center content Components only for rendering again and agin.
    3.Oue website Layouts no need to rendering again again which renders only once.
    4.which will manage our time

    different navbar for differrent page:
    1.we can use same above logics
    2.For chaniging nanbar 
      *  we can create different components
      *  we can create different Layouts
